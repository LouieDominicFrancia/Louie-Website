                        <p> I'm currently 21 right now but I don't feel like I'm 21. Maybe younger I guess? 18? Idk, It feels like my teenage years was stolen from me because of the pandemic. That's the reason why I love to explore and discover new things these days. </p>

                        <p> I'm living in Santa Mesa right now because I was fortunate enough to convince my parents to let me live on my own in an Apartment near PUP. Luckily, my apartment is just a walking distance from CEA. I'm originally from Cavite btw. </p>

                        <p> Video games is a double edge sword. It's either you win and be happy about it, or you lose and be miserable. </p>

                        <p> I also have a "love and hate" relationship with this sport. It's like math but people are too competitive about it. </p>

                        <p> The guitar is the best instrument. Playing it always soothes me, and it's also convenient since you can carry it around. </p>

            <p> My life has always been quite mediocre and stagnant, it's always been the people around me that make it interesting and worth living. <br> If you wanna know more about me, just check out the About Tab. There's nothing much in it tbh.  </p>
